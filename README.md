# Sentiment_Analysis_bot
I have made my Sentiment analysis bot on Reddit and Twitter data sets of over 150k Comments and Tweets.
The model is using RNN(Recurrent Neural Network or Long Short Term Memory Network) to understand complex pattens in data.
The model has achieved upto 91% in with the test and validation set.
